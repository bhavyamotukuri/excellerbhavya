            <h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Welcome to PALS</em></h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;"> Here, we are dedicated to finding loving homes for pets in need. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome abandoned, neglected, and surrendered animals, ensuring they have a second chance at happiness.
                <br><br>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Our Story</em></h3>
                Established in 2024, PALS was founded by a group of passionate animal lovers who saw a need in our community to provide a safe haven for animals in crisis. Since our inception, we have worked tirelessly to make a difference in the lives of countless animals and families.
                <br><br>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Our Mission</em></h3>
                Our primary goal is to promote responsible pet ownership and reduce pet overpopulation through adoption, education, and advocacy. We believe that every animal deserves a loving home, and we are committed to matching each pet with the perfect family.
                <br><br>
    
                <h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>What Sets Us Apart</em></h3>
    
                No-Kill Policy: We are proud to be a no-kill shelter, meaning we do not euthanize animals due to lack of space or time. Instead, we provide each animal with the care and support they need until they find their forever home.
                
                Compassionate Care: Our team of dedicated staff and volunteers provide personalized care and attention to each animal in our care. From medical treatment to behavioral training, we ensure that every pet receives the support they need to thrive.
                
                Community Outreach: We actively engage with our community through educational programs, outreach events, and partnerships with local businesses and organizations. By raising awareness about pet adoption and responsible pet ownership, we hope to create a more compassionate society for animals.
                <br><br>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b></em>How You Can Help?</em></b></h3>
                <p style="text-align: center;">As a non-profit organization, we rely on the generosity of supporters like you to continue our lifesaving work. Whether through donations, volunteering, or adopting a pet, there are many ways you can make a difference in the lives of animals in need.</p>
